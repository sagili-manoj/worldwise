# WorldWise - Map-Based Travel App

## Overview
WorldWise is a map-based React web application that allows users to explore cities and countries interactively using the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library for map rendering. The app features user authentication, city and country listings, and a form to add new locations, all within a protected route structure. It uses React Router for navigation, lazy loading for performance optimization, and context providers for state management.

## Features
- Interactive map powered by Leaflet to display cities and countries
- User authentication with a fake auth context for demo purposes
- City and country lists with detailed views for individual cities
- Form to add new locations
- Protected routes to secure the main app layout
- Lazy-loaded pages for improved performance
- Responsive design with a full-page spinner for loading states
- 404 page for handling invalid routes

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/worldwise.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd worldwise
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
3. Explore the app:
   - Visit the homepage, product, or pricing pages.
   - Log in using the demo credentials (if applicable) to access the protected app section.
   - Interact with the map to view cities and countries or add new locations via the form.

## Project Structure
- `src/App.jsx`: Main entry point defining routes and context providers.
- `src/pages/`: Contains lazily loaded page components (`Homepage`, `Product`, `Pricing`, `Login`, `AppLayout`, `PageNotFound`).
- `src/components/`: Reusable components like `CityList`, `CountryList`, `City`, `Form`, and `SpinnerFullPage`.
- `src/contexts/`: Context providers for cities (`CitiesContext`) and authentication (`FakeAuthContext`).
- `dist/`: Build output with optimized CSS and JS files.

System: I'm sorry, but it looks like your message was cut off. It seems you were in the middle of providing a project structure for the WorldWise project. Would you like me to continue where you left off, or would you prefer me to address something specific about the project structure or another aspect of the README.md? Since you previously asked for a `README.md` in GitHub-flavored Markdown format based on the provided `App.jsx` file, I'll assume you want to complete the `README.md` with the remaining project structure and other sections, ensuring all Markdown formatting (headings, code blocks, etc.) renders correctly on GitHub.

Below is the completed `README.md` with the project structure section finished and additional sections, wrapped in the required `<xaiArtifact/>` tag. I'll use a new `artifact_id` since this is a new artifact, not an update to the previous one.

<xaiArtifact artifact_id="f0f150fe-6eec-4c62-8563-d3e1865876ca" artifact_version_id="272caa64-1862-4320-ad62-c70284dbe5fc" title="README.md" contentType="text/markdown">

- `dist/`: Build output with optimized CSS and JS files (e.g., `index-59fcab9b.css` ~30.56 kB, `index-f7c12d89.js` ~572.44 kB).

## Dependencies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For client-side routing
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - For interactive maps
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - Build tool (assumed based on standard React setup)

## Build
To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
The optimized output will be in the `dist/` folder. Serve the `dist/` folder using a static server (e.g., `npx serve dist`) to test the production build.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
